# Alfred

This project aims to create a back-end bot with front-end available on differents services like Facebook Messenger, Google Home etc... We want to create builds for Windows and Linux to have a personnal assistant. For the moment the main language is Rust but in a perfect world we could create bindings that would allow everyone to create their own back-end and the bot could have a core that manage output on all services.

# Prototype :

I have an idea but all improvements are welcome. I want to create a repository call "plugins" with all backend service. An other folder call "core" with functions that must be called in the plugins. Functions such as (send message()) which gonna work on all services.
